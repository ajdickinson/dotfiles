# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfile configuration, allowing for a consistent computing experience across multiple machines. These days I primarily use GNU/Linux via the Arch Linux distribution.

I manage the various configuration files in this repo using GNU Stow. This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:

```
stow .
```

# Inspiration

THe inspiration for this configuration comes from the dotfiles by [dreamsofcode-io](https://github.com/dreamsofcode-io/dotfiles) (which is inspired by the [dotfiles by daviwil](https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles). If you are looking for inspiration for nvim, tmux, emacs config, or how to setup system configuration synchronization, I'd suggest you watch his videos.
